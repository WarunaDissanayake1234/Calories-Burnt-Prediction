# Calories Burnt Prediction with XGBoost Regressor

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts calories burnt using XGBoost Regressor.

## Overview

This project implements an XGBoost Regressor model to predict calories burnt. Python programming language is used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Calories-Burnt-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Download the fmendes-DAT263x-demos dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos).
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

4. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, implement XGBoost Regressor, and predict calories burnt.
